# My Contacts Website

**My Contacts** is a responsive and clean contact management website that fetches and displays user data using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). Built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, it provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. It's ideal for showcasing a simple contact interface with dynamically loaded content.
